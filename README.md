## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

gRPC has several advantages over REST for some use cases, I feel it behooves me to understand at least some of the basics of it so to have a better understanding of how it works and how to use it, at least enough to be able to ascertain whether it is the right tool for the job.

This is a basic example of how to use tonic to create a gRPC API.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

TODO

### Prerequisites

`brew install protobuf`

### Installing

TODO

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

TODO

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
